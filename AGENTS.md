# Stardown cloud project

- Work in the selected cloud environment. Do not access or operate the user's computer.
- Preserve existing levels and user changes. Use confirmed grids or coordinates; do not guess unresolved map cells or retry a blocked image-transfer route without new authorization relevant to that route.
- The current delivery branch is `develop`. Use normal commits and pushes, preserve remote history, and verify the remote SHA. Do not force-push, create a PR, or publish the game unless separately instructed.
- Run `python3 tools/verify.py --visual --display :97` when changing gameplay, levels, or navigation. A headless run does not prove rendering works. Check an actual legal solution for every new level and keep existing level regressions passing.

## Required walkthrough for every completed level

The user requires one complete gameplay demonstration video for every level. This is part of finishing a level, including future work.

1. Finish and validate the level, then commit its implementation before producing the video.
2. Record the actual Godot viewport, using legal input from the level's initial state to explicit victory. Deterministic keyboard replay is allowed. Include every movement and push at a readable speed; do not teleport, edit game state to win, or substitute a screenshot montage.
3. Store videos under the repository root `video/`, grouped by chapter: `video/chapter_01/level_01.mp4`, `video/chapter_01/level_02.mp4`, and the corresponding numbered paths for later chapters and levels.
4. Prefer browser-compatible H.264, `yuv420p`, and MP4 fast-start. Keep file sizes reasonable. Do not record an unrelated desktop or commit temporary raw AVI files.
5. Verify metadata, duration, nonzero frame count, and full decoding. Inspect the first and final frames for the correct level, initial state, and victory. Retain the replay path and verification evidence.
6. Commit the videos and updated documentation afterward, push normally, and verify the final remote SHA. Report implementation and video commits and the actual repository video links.

`tools/record_playthrough.gd` uses normal press/release events and checked paths from `levels/solutions/`. Run it with Godot Movie Maker, a real display, and `--fixed-fps 30`; it waits 18 frames per input, with initial and victory pauses. Extend the checked paths and recording coverage as new levels are added.
